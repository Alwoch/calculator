# functions for all the basic math operators typically found on simple calculators

 	# Functions:
     Add
     subtract
     multiply
     divide

  # Function #operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers then calls one of the above functions on the numbers

  # function that populates the display
  
  # store the first number that is input into the calculator when a user presses an operator

  # save which operation has been chosen and #operate() on then when the equal sign is pressed

  # display is populated and updated with the solution to the operation once #operate() has been called

  # Tests to pass
       # Users being able to string together several operations and get the right answer with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time eg 12+7-5*3=42;

       # Not evaluate more than a single pair at a time

       # round numbers with long decimals

       # pressing equal sign before entering the numbers or operator should show an error

       # pressing #clear should wipe out any existing data and the user is starting afresh

       # display an error when a user decides to divide by zero

       #decimals....

       #backspace button so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
